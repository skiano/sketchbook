# My Sketchbook

This is a collection of html/css/js for me to work out ideas. There is no build process or fanciness, just plain old web development.

Locally, you will need to serve the files through a web server (since it uses esm and import maps).

If you have python, try:

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/this/code
$ python3 -m http.server
```


You could use [http-server] if you have node installed:

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/this/code
$ http-server . -c-1
```
